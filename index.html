     <h1>Duan Bradley</h1> 


    <p>My name is Duan Bradley I am currently 14 years old and attend Mumford High School. I graduated from Paul Robeson Malcolm X with honors, 3.8 G.P.A. I am a all around kind of guy, I mingle with everybody and talk to everybody but when its comes to my grades, I am the most serious person ever. I am very goofy and I love to laugh and make jokes. I was born at Hutzel Hospital. I am from Detroit but have been to a couple places like, Alabama, Ohio, and Washington. I have 5 other siblings in all. I want to be a actor or a lawyer. I would love to be an actor because all I do is play and act people out and have fun most of the time. I plan to graduate from either Mumford High School or Cass Technical High School. My favorite subject is English and Math. My favorite subject is English because I love to learn new things and English always end up surprising me and I like Math because I love to do the work, when it comes to easy stuff I'm very good at then nobody can really stop me, I feel like it. My favorite food is cheeseburgers and spaghetti, I love all different types of food but those my favorite. My current G.P.A is a 4.0.</p>
